#Customer Churn Analysis

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn data. The goal of this project is to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and to build predictive models to identify customers who are likely to leave. This analysis can help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

Features:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values by replacing them with the mean of the respective column.
Converting categorical features into numerical ones using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Eliminating duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing the distribution of numerical features.
Analyzing the relationship between different features and customer churn.
Identifying patterns and insights from the data.

Predictive Modeling:

Implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees to predict customer churn.
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

Feature Scaling:

Applying standard scaling to numerical features to enhance model performance.

Outlier Detection:
Identifying and handling outliers in the data to improve model accuracy.
